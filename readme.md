1) Algorithms and Data Structures: Mastering data structures was the key. This means not only knowing it conceptually but also putting it into practice in real-world simulations. Analyzing algorithms and preparing myself to be able to tackle any similar problem the next time it comes across. 
 
2) Consistency: Mastering hard SWC problems takes a lot of practice. The trick to getting effective while solving hard problems is to rehearse problems regularly. I tried to learn new concepts every day. Solve one question a day if not more!! After learning a new approach, I instantly look for applications and solve issues with them. And most importantly, I adapted the habit of learning.

3) Complexity is complex: I learned how to calculate average-case complexity rather than worst-case or best-case.  Initially, I got caught up in the pursuit of faster and faster execution time. Later, I learned not to squander time over-engineering a specific API. I moved on to the next API if the solution is acceptable and has the balance. 

1) Measuring Performance: Before talking about how to improve, it needs to define what improvement means. The bottleneck in a specific portion of the system slows down the overall performance of the application. Now, I look for the bottlenecks when it comes to performance improvement rather than making faster a specific API/ portion. 

2) Solidifying Knowledge: Learning is great. But retaining and applying the knowledge in project work is really important. I apply algorithmic knowledge while solving critical issues in my project work. 

3) Constant Refactoring and room for improvement: Code refactoring is the process of changing the source code without modifying itâ€™s functional behavior, in order to improve the code readability and improve the maintainability by reducing the complexity of the code, as well as improving the code extensibility. Failure to perform refactoring can result in the accumulation of technical debt which the developer has to pay at a later point in time. While solving SWC problems, I tried to refactor my code till the last minute to improve the overall efficiency.
